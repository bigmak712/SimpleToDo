# Pre-work - *SimpleTodo*

**SimpleTodo** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: **Timothy Mak**

Time spent: **25** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [X] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [X] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

  I think just learning about Android Studio and how to create an Android app was a challenge in itself since this
  is the first time I've worked with Android. Since the only app building experience I have is with iOS, getting
  used to the Android Studio was hard since I'm so used to coding in XCode.
  
  Trying to implement the additional features was also challenging since I focused mainly on trying to create a 
  custom adapter and save data onto a database. Most of my time went into just researching and trying to see and
  understand how it worked. Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to work out the bugs so I was unable to 
  implement those features.
